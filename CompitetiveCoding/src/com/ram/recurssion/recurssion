Recursion:
===========
->base condition
	->base condition is a smallest or biggest input of programe which is  exit condition of our programe
	->base condition is checked every time by compiler if base condition is true then it will stops the 
	  recursive function call or else it will skip the base condition
	 ->the code inside the base condition excutes only once at when base condition is true
->recursive function
	->recursive function is a function which calls itself until base condition is true
	->we have to choose our recursive function in such way that by calling recursively we have to 
		reach the base condtion
	->based on this recursive function we have to types of recursive function
	->linear recursion->consits only single recursive function
	->binary recursion
		->consists of two or recursive function
		->who binary recursion works?
		ex: f(n),f(m)
		for every f(x) x belongs to n
		it will excutes first f(x) completly after that it will goes to f(y) y belongs to m
	 
->area above the recursive function
	->if we write any code in this area it will execute the code before calling function i.e before 
	 inserting any element in to the stack
->area below the recursive function
	->if we write any code in this area it will execute the code after calling function i.e while
	   termination function or while removing of any element from the stack.
if problem can be solved by using loops it can be solved by using recursion even more complex problems can be solved by recursion that not
can be solved by loops.
